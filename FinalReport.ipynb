    "## Optimization Draft Report\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with computers, it is easy to have inefficient codes likely due to ease of understanding. As such, when program size grows, the runtime speed will suffer and results in a slower program. The goal of the 'P0 Compiler Optimization' is to implement various optimization techiniques on the code generated by the P0 compiler. At the current state, the P0 compiler already have implemented some optimization techniques (i.e. constant folding and constant propagation), the plan is to expand on these techniques. Doing this will in turn improve the speed at runtime, but will be done at the cost of overall code length and/or \"cleanliness\".\n",

    "##### Assumptions\n",
    "The optimization makes assumption that the optimization techniques will be applied for the MIPS code generated by the compiler, and not for the compiler itself.\n"

Including that work, the complexity is hard because it requires a good understanding of how the language works and how statement() works in particular. While the implementation is fairly round-about, and probably could be simplified, it ended up being fairly long (because it needed to skip particular parts). Also because there are many errors encountered along the way."
